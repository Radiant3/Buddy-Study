# StudyBuddy

## Testing Backend

Make sure you are in studybuddy folder using `cd studybuddy`
run `node server.js`. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 

## Build and serve - only front end testing (prettiness)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
